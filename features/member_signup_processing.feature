Feature: Processing membership signups

  In order to make sure that new member signups are managed properly in ODI systems
  As a membership programme manager
  I want something to process all membership signups

    # In many of these scenarios, we are using the order Given/Then/When, rather than
    # Given/When/Then. This is intentional, and lets us set up Resque expectations in
    # a better way in the steps.

  Background:
    Given my name is "Joe Nerd"
    And my email address is "joe@nerd.eg"
    And I work for "Nerd Enterprises Inc"
    And I have an invoice contact email of "finance@nerd.eg"
    And I have an invoice phone number of "+1 1010 101010"
    And I have an invoice address (line1) of "01 Geek Street, Techington"
    And I have an invoice address (city) of "Austin"
    And I have an invoice address (region) of "Techsus"
    And I have an invoice address (country) of "USA" 
    And I have an invoice address (postcode) of "01010"
    And my organisation has a tax registration number "A0A0A0A0"
    And I have a membership id "01010101"

  Scenario: add supporters to new style invoicing queue
    Given I requested 1 membership at the level called "supporter"
    And my purchase order reference is "ABC000001"
    Then the invoice description should read "ODI Supporter Membership (1010101)"
    And the invoice price should be "45"
    And I should be added to the invoicing queue
    When the signup processor runs

  Scenario: add members to new style invoicing queue
    Given I requested 1 membership at the level called "member"
    And my purchase order reference is "ABC000001"
    Then the invoice description should read "ODI Member Membership (1010101)"
    And the invoice price should be "400"
    And I should be added to the invoicing queue
    When the signup processor runs

# currently an issue with leading zeros being removed from postcode and membership number
