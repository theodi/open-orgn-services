Feature: Monitoring attendee signups

  In order to make sure that all event attendees are managed propery in ODI systems
  As a training manager
  I want something to monitor all attendee signups

	# In many of these scenarios, we are using the order Given/Then/When, rather than
	# Given/When/Then. This is intentional, and lets us set up Resque expectations in
	# a better way in the steps.
